### Research Question: Is Sweden’s no-lockdown strategy effective in managing the implications of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic?

## ABSTRACT
Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders around the globe have taken a stand in imposing a lockdown on its nation. One of the most controversial responses to COVID-19, Sweden however, did not enforce a lockdown unlike its European neighbours.

\
The research aims to explore the differences in Government policies (i.e. lockdown) in tackling the COVID-19 transmission. It aims to determine whether Sweden’s strategy had subdued these repercussions and may act as recommendation to global policy-makers in their responses to future public health crisis.

Lockdown helps to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent overwhelming of the healthcare system. To measure the effectiveness of lockdown, analysis will be performed on the consequences of COVID-19: (1) number of COVID-19 cases, (2) number of COVID-19 deaths, (3) Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) and (4) Mobility trends before and after a lockdown. A comparison will be made between Sweden versus the average of 5 countries that alternatively imposed lockdown. The 5 nations are: Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Portugal. The mean of these 5 European states are taken to benchmark against Sweden; to represent what Sweden could have achieved if it had imposed a lockdown similar to these countries. The countries are chosen due to its close resemblance to Sweden before the lockdown in terms of their population and urbanisation rate. These datasets cover a duration of an estimated of 8-months, from January to early September 2020.
\
\
Findings show that Sweden’s no-lockdown strategy is less effective in controlling the effects of COVID-19 as compared to its neighbouring countries that had enforced it, due to higher community mobility, higher COVID-19 cases and deaths. There are no signs that its GDP was better off than other countries.
